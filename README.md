# Kcross
Quick second order summaries for multivariate point patterns. 

Idea is to compute all cross-K's fast, not just one pair. Main function is *K_cross_all_box*: 

* Supports 2d and 3d (actually any dimension)
* Translation edge correction
* Supports only a rectangular/cuboidal window at the moment.


Other functions are poorly documented and usually only for 2d.
