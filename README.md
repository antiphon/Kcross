# Kcross
Quick second order summaries for multivariate point patterns. 

Idea is to quickly compute all cross-K's fast, not just one pair. Main function is K_cross_all_box, supports 2d and 3d. 

Other functions are poorly documented and mostly for 2d only.

Contact the author in case you want something developed further.
